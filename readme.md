# 🏖️ Beach

A little Deno server, with builtin support for server rendering custom elements.

With Beach you get:

* Server-side rendering if custom elements, including shadow DOM thanks to [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://web.dev/declarative-shadow-dom/).
* Automatic inclusion of polyfills for you.
* Partial hydration; only include the JavaScript when needed.
